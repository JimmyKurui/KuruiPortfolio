# KuruiPortfolio

My portfolio site showcasing projects, contributions and some of my other work not found on GitHub. This is a recreation meant to replace the previous version hosted on Heroku app space.

## Rollout
**Version 1** - I am currently building my portfolio 1.0 version using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript 
**Version 2** - I will build it using React.Js and Redux framework for frontend. Node.Js will serve the backend
